# Blockchain (not that kind)

If you're looking to score the latest in hot scam-tokens, sorry, I can't help you. This is a chain of blocks, specifically blocks for ActivityPub/OStatus instances.

This is the first version! Please check it out and help me iron out the bugs.

This is a brief, machine-readable version of my long and documented [human-readable version](http://telegra.ph/Instances-to-silencesuspend-on-Mastodon-06-23).

If you're new to this, I recommend you check the human-readable one for all these instances first just so you know what you're doing and who you're blocking. I also try to explain what the reasons are below if you're not sure.


---

## Structure

So the blocklist has two arrays, one with metadata and one with the actual instances.

Each instance has a list of reasons as to why they are on the blocklist. I'm not that much of a programmer, but I assume you can use those to filter which instances you want to block.


---


## Reason tags
These are the things that I personally have specific evidence of. These instances may be guilty of more things.

'A-' prefixes mean that the administration doesn't necessarily engage in, encourage, or endorse that behaviour themselves but they do enable it by letting users on their instance do it instead. Not all tags have A-prefixes, I'll mention which ones do.


#### advertising

Corporate advertising is enabled on this instance. There's a difference between personal and community announcements of things and straight-up corporate advertising. This is for the latter, not the former.


#### harrassment (w/ A-harrassment)

The administration has engaged in, encouraged or endorsed harrassment, whether within OStatus/ActivityPub protocols, or elsewhere.

#### corporate

Corporate-owned space.

#### FVZ (w/ A-FVZ)

Stands for 'Fascist speech/Violent speech/Zero-moderation'. 

These are safe spaces for fascist, violent and shitty ideologies, including:




- Alt-Right ( [[link 1]](http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Defend-Europe-Briefing_210717.pdf) [[link 2]](http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/2017/10/31/explained-identitarian-movement-alt-right/) [[link 3]](https://alternativeright.hopenothate.com/) )
- Identitarian ( [[link 2]](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2015/10/12/american-racists-work-spread-%E2%80%98identitarian%E2%80%99-ideology) [[link 2]](http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/2017/10/31/explained-identitarian-movement-alt-right/) )
- GamerGate
- [Male Supremacy](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/male-supremacy) ([Manosphere](http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/2017/10/24/hope-not-hate-explains-manosphere/), Red Pill, MRA, etc.)
- ...and even more awful shit! I will detail them later.

*(links here are links to resources from experienced anti-hate group NGOs, I'll keep trying to add links as I go along)*

The reason they are all in one category is that the borders between each other are very fuzzy (they have great ideological similarities), organisations in these areas tend to be tightly related and connected to each other and one particular branch is often a gateway to another.

Not all of these instances necessarily have all of these things, and there is a spectrum to the volume of this content. But this shit is still ultimately toxic and not what you should be allowing if you want to make your instance safe and pleasant for people who aren't violent and have reasonable things to say.


Other people charitably call it 'channer culture' or call it by the way *they* frame it, which is ""free-speech zone"". I'd rather not label them on their own terms, especially when they don't actually give a shit about the free speech of trans people, queer people, black people, etc.


#### jingoism

Oxford Dictionary:

> extreme patriotism, especially in the form of aggressive or warlike foreign policy

For the lack of a better term. This refers to just one instance right now, Counter.Social.

[Check out my human-readable blocklist](http://telegra.ph/Instances-to-silencesuspend-on-Mastodon-06-23) for the summary on them.

#### lolicon

Sexualised depictions of minors. (While 'Lolicon' actually refers to a particular subset, westerners tend to use it to mean anything illustrated and under-age)

#### spam

The administration enables spam accounts.

#### untagged NSFW

It is what it is really.
