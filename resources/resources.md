# Resources for hate stuff

If you're interested in understanding hate groups, speech and rhetoric, 

Sorry that this is very anglophone-centric right now ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

**Also content warning! All of these are going to contain lots of unhappy things from the start!**

## Watchdogs

Here's a bunch of places that specialise in tracking these subjects. They have varying levels of specialisation or regional focus.

#### [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org)

American hate group watch dog, anti-hate campaigner. They are also a legal non-profit fighting hate, discrimination and threats to civil liberties.

<br/>

#### [Searchlight](http://www.searchlightmagazine.com)

A magazine investigating racism, fascism and antisemitism in Britain and elsewhere.

<br/>


#### [ShitRedditSays](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/)

A Reddit community dedicated to showcasing the worst (re: bigoted, creepy, sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic etc. etc. etc.) commentary across Reddit.

Contains more of a humorous tone compared to the other links, and the community is more of a venting place (not to say it diminishes it's quality, just that it's different in tone). An easy way to get an insight into the latest trends in typical anglophone internet hate speech discourse at a glance.

<br/>

#### [Right Wing Watch](http://www.rightwingwatch.org)

Blog dedicated to tracking far-right movements, figures and rhetoric in the US.

## Symbolism and rhetoric

#### Nazi / Neo-Nazi
- [**Nazi symbolism on Wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_symbolism) - A good primer on nazi symbols, and a lot of these can be seen quite frequently on white naationalists on the internet and IRL (many of these featured quite heavily in the Charlottessville rally of 2017).
- [**ADL Hate Symbols Database**](https://www.adl.org/education-and-resources/resource-knowledge-base/hate-symbols?page=4) - It's important to keep in mind that people on the internet with hateful opinions tend to be less overt and won't use these kinds of symbols. Like with the SPLC, a lot of this is related to IRL dedicated and overt hate groups.
