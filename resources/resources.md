# Resources for hate stuff

If you're interested in understanding hate groups, speech and rhetoric, 

Sorry that this is very centered on 'western' (ie. North America and Europe) hate group types right now.

**Also content warning! All of these are going to contain lots of unhappy things from the start!**

## Hate group watchdogs

Here's a bunch of places that specialise in tracking these subjects. They have varying levels of specialisation or regional focus.

#### [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org)

American hate group watch dog, anti-hate campaigner. They are also a legal non-profit fighting hate, discrimination and threats to civil liberties. 

They have been meticulously tracking individual hate groups in the US IRL since 1990. They have recently begun expanding their investigations to online hate groups more.

- [**Hatewatch**](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch) - A blog with regular news about the happenings of American hate groups and well-established figures in these movements.

- [**Extremist Files - Ideologies**](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology) - Neat summaries of common/well-established hate ideologies they tend to encounter in their research and investigations.

<br/>

#### [Hope Not Hate](https://www.hopenothate.org.uk)

British hate group watchdog, and anti-racist political campaign group. They use a combination of standard research, undercover operatives and political counter-campaigning to fight hate groups in the UK.

- [**Blog**](https://www.hopenothate.org.uk/updates/blog/)

<br/>

#### [Hope Not Hate (US)](https://hopenothate.com) 

American branch of Hope Not Hate, focusing on the Alt-right.




- [**The International Alternative Right**](https://alternativeright.hopenothate.com) - A special mini-site dedicated to the alt-right and alt-light. Featuring an extensive undercover investigation of many of their IRL meetings annd movements, which is in the process of being compiled into a documentary right now.

- [**Control Alt-Right Delete**](https://hopenothate.com/ctrl-alt-right-delete/) - A weekly blog/newsletter dedicated to understanding how the alt-right works and developing strategies to fight back.

<br/>

#### [We Hunted The Mammoth](https://www.wehuntedthemammoth.com)

A blog tracking and exposing the commentary and ideological trends among the Male Supremacy/'Manosphere' movements, such as PUA, Red Pill, Incel, MGTOW and more.


<br/>

#### [Searchlight](http://www.searchlightmagazine.com)

A magazine investigating racism, fascism and antisemitism in Britain and elsewhere.

<br/>


#### [ShitRedditSays](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/)

A Reddit community dedicated to showcasing the worst (re: bigoted, creepy, sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic etc. etc. etc.) commentary across Reddit.

Contains more of a humorous tone compared to the other links, and the community is more of a venting place (not to say it diminishes it's quality, just that it's different in tone). An easy way to get an insight into the latest trends in typical anglophone internet hate speech discourse at a glance.

<br/>

#### [Right Wing Watch](http://www.rightwingwatch.org)

Blog dedicated to tracking far-right movements, figures and rhetoric in the US.

<br/>

#### [The TERFs](http://theterfs.com)

A website that breaks down what TERFs are, what their beliefs are, and has a blog that tracks actions and rhetoric within this movement.

## Explainer posts

#### Alt-right
- [**Alt-Right summary by SPLC**](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/alt-right) - Very comprehensive.
- [**What is Weaponised Activism?**](https://medium.com/@melissaryan/what-is-weaponization-836dc8b006b9) - This post quickly and effectively points out the differences between alt-right activism and healthy, reasonable activism, and why the former cannot adequately be protected as free speech. (I mean, this is separated from the bigoted rhetoric itself which is already a perfectly good reason.)
- [**Japan and the Alternative Right**](https://hopenothate.com/2018/04/20/japan-and-the-alternative-right/) - Or as I like to call it, 'what's with all the anime stuff'?


#### Male Supremacy / Manosphere (MRA, PUA, The Red Pill, Incel, MGTOW, etc.)
- [**Male Supremacy summary by SPLC**](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/male-supremacy) Very comprehensive, and goes across the spectrum of male supremacist beliefs.


#### Neo-reactionary
- [**Mouthbreathing Machiavellis Dream of a Silicon Reich**](https://thebaffler.com/latest/mouthbreathing-machiavellis) - A piece summarising the ideological problems, as well as the potential dangers of the neo-reactionary movement.

## Symbolism and rhetoric

It's important to remember these symbols and words should be treated with some degree of  context (not the psuedo-ironic card the actual culprits like to play however). For instance, people can use [(((echoes)))](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Alt-right_glossary#.28.28.28.29.29.29) sarcastically as a form of defiance against anti-semitic abuse.


#### Alt-Right

- [**Alt-Right Glossary on RationalWiki.org**](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Alt-right_glossary) - [[note 1]](#notes-1) A very comprehensive list of in-group terms and buzzwords.


#### Nazi / Neo-Nazi
- [**Nazi symbolism on Wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_symbolism) - A good primer on nazi symbols, and a lot of these can be seen quite frequently on white nationalists on the internet and IRL (many of these featured quite heavily in the Charlottessville rally of 2017).
- [**ADL Hate Symbols Database**](https://www.adl.org/education-and-resources/resource-knowledge-base/hate-symbols?page=4) - It's important to keep in mind that people on the internet with hateful opinions tend to be less overt and won't use these kinds of symbols. Like with the SPLC, a lot of this is related to IRL dedicated and overt hate groups.

#### Male Supremacy / Manosphere (MRA, PUA, The Red Pill, Incel, MGTOW, etc.)

- [**Manosphere Glossary on RationalWiki.org**](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Manosphere_glossary) - [[note 1]](#notes-1) Probably the most comprehensive glossary of Manosphere in-group terms that exists right now.

## Notes


1. <a id='notes-1'></a> I'm painfully aware of the baggage the use of the word 'rational' has and RationalWiki is definitely not perfect. However, it is pretty great at summarising and collecting information about hate groups in ways that I have not seen anywhere else.
2. Alt-Rightists and Neo-nazis are often essentially the same, but not necessarily (especially in the case of the alt-light), so they are separated when it comes to categorised lists.
