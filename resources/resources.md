# Resources for hate stuff

If you're interested in understanding hate groups, speech and rhetoric, 

Because of my background and languages, this is very centered on North American and European hate group types right now.

**Also content warning! All of these are going to contain lots of unhappy things from the start!**

## Hate group watchdogs

Here's a bunch of places that specialise in tracking these subjects. They have varying levels of specialisation or regional focus.

#### [Hope Not Hate](https://www.hopenothate.org.uk)

British hate group watchdog, and anti-racist political campaign group.

- [**Blog**](https://www.hopenothate.org.uk/updates/blog/)

<br/>

#### [Hope Not Hate (US)](https://hopenothate.com) 

American branch of Hope Not Hate, focusing on the Alt-right.




- [**The International Alternative Right**](https://alternativeright.hopenothate.com) - A special mini-site dedicated to the alt-right and alt-light. Featuring an extensive undercover investigation of many of their IRL meetings annd movements, which is in the process of being compiled into a documentary right now.

- [**Control Alt-Right Delete**](https://hopenothate.com/ctrl-alt-right-delete/) - A weekly blog/newsletter dedicated to understanding how the alt-right works and developing strategies to fight back.

<br/>


#### [ShitRedditSays](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/)

A Reddit community dedicated to showcasing the worst (re: bigoted, creepy, sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic etc. etc. etc.) commentary across Reddit.

Contains more of a humorous tone compared to the other links, and the community is more of a venting place (not to say it diminishes it's quality, just that it's different in tone). An easy way to get an insight into the latest trends in typical anglophone internet hate speech discourse at a glance.

<br/>

#### [Right Wing Watch](http://www.rightwingwatch.org)

Blog dedicated to tracking far-right movements, figures and rhetoric in the US.

## Notes


1. <a id='notes-1'></a> I'm painfully aware of the baggage the use of the word 'rational' has and RationalWiki is definitely not perfect. However, it is pretty great at summarising and collecting information about hate groups in ways that I have not seen anywhere else.
2. Alt-Rightists and Neo-nazis are often essentially the same, but not necessarily (especially in the case of the alt-light), so they are separated when it comes to categorised lists.
