# Internet Tools

Here's a bunch of tools that will help you prune basement-dwelling sociopaths from the rest of the internet:


----

## General Tools

##### [donotlink.it](https://donotlink.it)

When you link a website, you can improve a website's search rankings, even if you didn't intend to promote it at all. As you might imagine, this plays well into the hands of people who like to create 'controversies'.

This is where this tool comes in - this website allows you to link to shitty web pages and people still, but in a way that will suppress the website from being improved in search rankings.

## Reddit tools

These two tag Reddit users as you're browsing Reddit based on their posting parameters, so it can help you identify bad faith actors and manbabies when scrolling through posts and conversations.

##### [Reddit Pro Tools (Chrome)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-pro-tools/bngghjoiddeibhdpmljndljejnoihkej)

It examines various Reddit users' comment histories and automatically tags them based on certain parameters (like if they have too much negative karma overall, if they get too much positive karma on certain shitty subreddits like /r/The_Donald, if they link to websites like Breitbart, Daily Wire, etc.) It's configurable too.

Because it trawls through large amounts of individual users' histories to find this out, it does guzzle bandwidth, so be warned.

##### [masstagger (Firefox, Chrome)](https://masstagger.com/)

It tags Reddit users based on how many times they have been posting on certain crappy subreddits.
