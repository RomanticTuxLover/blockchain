# JSON List

It's back!

I'd recommend having a glance at [the original human-readable list](list.md) just so you know what you're getting into.

The JSON is a flat list of objects with two parts - `domain` and `reasons`.

`reasons` are a list of strings, each string corresponds to a section on the [human-readable list](list.md):

- `abuse` - Harrassment and direct abuse to other users
- `advertising`
- `corporate` - Corporate-owned instances
- `dct` - Dangerous conspiracy theories
- `hostile` - Other hostile admin conduct
- `spam`
- `security-risk`
- `ums` - Unwilling to moderate hate speech and violent speech
- `underage-porn` - Illustrated sexualised depictions of people who appear to be minors
- `vsz` - Violent speech space
