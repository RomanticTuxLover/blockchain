This is a community hub for highlandarrow.com, a GamerGate website ([here's one of their articles](https://www.highlandarrow.com/current-events/en/soapbox/163-breaking-arrows-barely-anon.html)).

If you know what GamerGate means, enough said really, but here's some more stuff from the members going into victim-blaming patterns (particularly from the admin, @maiyannah) and complaining about their strawman perception of what identity politics is below.

(GamerGate and victim-blaming? who knew.)

If you aren't that aware of what GamerGate really is/was and what took place, I strongly recommend that you check out [this wiki article from RationalWiki](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gamergate) (IK the name of the wiki is kinda bad, the site isn't perfect but they do some very good stuff sometimes).
