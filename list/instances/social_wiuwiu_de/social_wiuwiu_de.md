I made a report to the administration concerning this user (@orangecoastcollegeprivacy), who posts content that dehumanises non-binary and trans people and makes alt-light dogwhistles.

The administration decided to not take moderation actions against this user because what this user did wasn't against their CoC.

Just basic anti-trans and anti-NB stuff.

Ben Shapiro is the former editor of Brietbart and is the founder and current editor-in-chief of The Daily Wire, another alt-right 'news' source.

One of his personal talking points on his media channels is the 'militant homosexual agenda'. He is also a virulent transphobe and anti-abortion activist.

'Western civilisation' (as in the hashtag in that post) is a frequent Alt-Right/Alt-Light dogwhistle and narrative (that 'western civilisation' (whatever they think western civilisation is) is under threat from what they see as 'political correctness').
