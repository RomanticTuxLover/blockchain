This instance replaces [kawaiistu.moe](../kawaiistu_moe/kawaiistu_moe.md). (and if you try to view kawaiistu.moe, it redirects to this domain). The admin doesn't seem to have changed their opinions of what they posted thus far, so this instance is on the list also.

See [kawaiistu.moe](../kawaiistu_moe/kawaiistu_moe.md)'s article to understand why you might want to put this on your blocklist.
