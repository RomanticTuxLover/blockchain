Seems to be a basic ActivityPub server which has an account has made a shitty toot pretending to be Gargron.

The username has been specifically designed to impersonate Gargron by obfuscating the real domain part of the user handle (`Gargron＠mastodon.social⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀@ap.uwu.st`).
