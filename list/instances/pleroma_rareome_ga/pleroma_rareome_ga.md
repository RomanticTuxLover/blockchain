**The code that the instance is running does not acknowledge blocks or privacy settings, so it just shows everything to everyone.**

Also just general edgelord stuff from what I have seen so far.


### example 1

This was boosted by the instance admin themselves.

### example 2
'Niggys', 'don't loli too hard'

### example 3
'[sperging](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sperging)', basically a shitty ableist thing to say.
