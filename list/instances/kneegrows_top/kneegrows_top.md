This is a stub because the instance is already down, but I'm going to record this in case the instance admin ever gets bored again and decides to waste their resources on this instance some more.

This was an instance that was created with a domain name so clever (because it sounds like a certain N word), it is bound you to the point of making your head explode, leaving nothing behind but a puddle of liberal tears.

This instance is now down, so I am using other peoples' screenshots, but I can confirm that I have personally seen these posts during the time it was active.
