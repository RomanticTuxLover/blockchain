This instance's admin decided to harass a non-binary person and got kicked off of their old instance, so they made this instance instead.

(This is a relatively old addition to the list, thus there isn't any evidence of the harrassment, or it was not included in the first place to protect the victim. I can't remember which it was, but I remember seeing the original incident of harrassment.)

(PS. If you're not tired of people labelling their shittiness as 'free speech' yet, you might be by the time you get to the end of this list.)
