The administration of this instance is self-evidently pretty reactionary and displays some sort of bad ignorance and hostility towards queer people.

"SJWs", "free speech", "no censorship", the usual dogwhistles.

The admin displays nice contempt towards pronoun usage and non-binary people ("Pronouns: fuck off"). As well as that whole thing of not understanding the issue queer people face and thus assuming all they want is special treatment instead ("Orientation: Why does it matter").

(The 4th portion says "Nazi?: Stop labelling ppl u don't agree with!!!" ðŸ™„)

The admin also puts 'sex' instead of 'gender' in the first field, which could plausibly indicate they have gender-essentialist views, combined with the rest of this instance and their profile.

[The rules of the instance](https://socnet.supes.com/terms) say "Do not attack people personally", "Do not harass people" and "No bullying", but it's self-evidently hypocritical when the admin already displays hostility and contempt for certain groups of people.
