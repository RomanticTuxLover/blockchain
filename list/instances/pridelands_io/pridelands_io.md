I'm sure this kind of rhetoric is familiar to many people.

Other than the above instance description, this instance's admin was found engaging negatively in a conversation by making a lot of bad-faith assertions about religion and also making some insults. Really weird. ([Some of the thread can be found here](https://pridelands.io/@simba/99679140751322663), the rest of this was submitted to me by someone.)
