# Content Policy

### How is screencapped/linked content in BLOCKchain used?

**It is used to demonstrate what kinds of content or actions an instance finds acceptable.** It is not to suggest that they are the only instances of that kind of behaviour or that kind of content on that instance.

Sometimes content is not shown, because it is either illegal, or it is to protect a victim of abuse.


### What if I posted something that you screencapped and I don't want it on your list anymore?

I will only be willing to take it off if you're not directly an individual BLOCKchain is making an example of.

ie.

- You were the receipient of abuse/harrassment, not the instigator.
- You were a person who made a post that was boosted, and I used the fact that someone else boosted it to prove a point about the administration admitting to a particular behaviour or set of actions, but your post in itself was not harmful.

If you are one of these groups of people, you can DM [@blockchain@monsterpit.net](https://monsterpit.net/@blockchain) and I will gladly remove it.


If you have made a harmful or violent post or otherwise are an example of your instance's acceptance of those kinds of behaviours, you will not be taken off the example content.


### What if it has been a long time?

An individual drastically changing belief systems and behaviours (to the point they would formerly be on BLOCKchain but not at a later point in time) generally takes a long time, if it happens at all. Especially if they are a member of a particular social group, religious sect, hate group or cult.

I have no interest in holding someone up to behaviour they did years ago, but BLOCKchain is comparatively very young to that kind of time frame. This is something that will definitely be considered as time goes on.
