# About deleted instances

**If an instance that has been recorded on this list is deleted, it will still be maintained on this list, it will only be marked as deleted.**

This is for potential future reference and in case the instance may ever get resurrected or the owner of that domain makes a new instance with it.

It's not in my interest to hold an instance admin accountable for something they did years ago (if this blocklist lasts that amount of time). But like with any other removal or change to this list, it's going to be based on someone proving themselves, or that practically speaking a domain cannot be a threat any longer.

 

### Dead instances will only be deleted under these circumstances:

- The owner of that domain legitimately demonstrably changes their behaviour.
- The domain goes under new ownership to someone not related in any way to the previous owner.
- Enough time has passed where the threat of the instance coming back is negligible.
